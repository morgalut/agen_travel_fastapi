Travel Assistant
Project Focus
Build a travel assistant that demonstrates your ability to create natural, effective conversations
with LLMs. The technical implementation should be simple, allowing you to focus primarily on
prompt engineering and conversational quality.

Core Requirements
Conversation-First Design
●​ Create a travel planning assistant that can handle at least 3 different types of travel
queries (e.g., destination recommendations, packing suggestions, local attractions)
●​ Design the system to handle follow-up questions and maintain context across the
conversation
●​ Implement a conversation flow that feels natural and helpful to users
Enhanced Prompt Engineering
●​ Design your system prompts to extract maximum value from the LLM
●​ Include at least one "chain of thought" prompt that guides the LLM through a multi-step
reasoning process
●​ Implement prompt techniques that help the LLM provide concise, relevant responses
Simple Technical Implementation
●​ Use any programming language you're comfortable with
●​ Integrate with a free LLM API (Ollama, DeepSeek, etc.)
●​ Create a simple interface (can be CLI, basic web UI, or API endpoints) that allows
testing the conversation
Data Augmentation
●​ Integrate with at least one external API (weather, country info, etc.)
●​ Design prompts that effectively blend external data with LLM knowledge
●​ Implement a decision method for when to use external data vs. LLM knowledge
What to Prioritize
1.​ Conversation Quality: Focus on making the interactions feel natural and helpful
2.​ Prompt Design: Show your skill in crafting effective prompts that get the best results
3.​ Error Handling: Demonstrate how you recover from confused responses or
hallucinations
4.​ Context Management: Show how you maintain conversation history and context
Evaluation Focus
●​ How well the assistant maintains coherent, helpful conversations

●​ Quality and creativity of your prompt engineering approach
●​ How you handle edge cases and potential LLM limitations
●​ Your approach to blending external data with LLM capabilities
Submission
Submit your code via GitHub or zip file, including:
●​ All source code
●​ Sample conversation transcripts showing your system in action
●​ Brief notes on key prompt engineering decisions
This assignment is designed to showcase your ability to think about and implement effective
LLM conversations, rather than focusing on documentation or complex backend systems.
